## Transform Your Development Process with AI

AiCodeCalc is a sophisticated web-based calculator designed to estimate the financial and temporal costs associated with using Large Language Models (LLMs) for agent-based software development. Built with modern web technologies including Vite.js, React, and Tailwind CSS, it provides an intuitive dark-themed interface optimized for both desktop and mobile use.

The calculator features a cyberpunk-inspired design with real-time calculations, interactive visualizations, and comprehensive analytics. It helps organizations make data-driven decisions about AI implementation by:

- **Cost Analysis**: Calculate exact token usage, API costs, and operational expenses
- **Time Estimation**: Compare development timelines between traditional and AI-assisted approaches
- **Resource Planning**: Optimize allocation of both AI and human resources
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Track and analyze performance indicators and quality metrics

With support for multiple LLM models, advanced agent configurations, and detailed reporting, AiCodeCalc provides enterprise-grade analysis capabilities in an accessible web interface.
