# Project Setup

AiCodeCalc is a sophisticated calculator designed to analyze and compare the costs and efficiency of LLM-powered development versus traditional human development. This documentation provides detailed information about each component and how to use the calculator effectively.

The Project Setup section is the initial configuration step in the LLM Efficiency Calculator. This crucial phase establishes the fundamental parameters that will influence all subsequent calculations and cost estimations for your LLM-powered development workflow.
